This document describes the structure and usage of the configuration files that are part of every MHub model and orchestrate the MHub pipeline in so called workflows.

*We are currently writing this article. You can check config files in our models repository for working examples and look into the MHub-IO Module overvirew for a list of all available Modules and their configurable parameters.*
